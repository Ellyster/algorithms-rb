- Sequences
	- Sorting

| Name  | Eficiency | Type | Description | Notes |
| :----- | :---------: | :----: | :----------- | :----- |
| Insertion sort | O() | Insertion | Determine where the current items belongs in the list of sorted ones and insert it here | x |
| Shell sort | O() | Insertion | x | x |
| Merge sort | O() | Merge | Divide in two halfs, sort the first and second half of the list separately, then merge the sorted list | x |
| Bubble sort | O() | Exchange | For each pair of indices, swap the items if out of order | x |
| Cocktail sort | O() | Exchange | x | x |
| Quick sort | O(n log n) | Exchange | Select a pivot, divide the list into smaller than the pivot, pivot and bigger than the pivot, sort each separately  | Fast, small hidden constant |
| Selection sort | O() | Selection | Pick the smallest of the remaining elements, add it to the end of the sorted list | x |
| Heap sort | O() | Selection | Convert the list into a heap, keeep removing the largest element from the heap and adding it to the end of the list | x |
| Radix sort | O() | Non-comparison | Sorts strings letter by letter | x |
| Bucket sort | O() | Non-comparison | x | x |
