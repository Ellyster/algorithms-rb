# Algorithm: Selection sort
# Time complexity: Ðž(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary
# Stable: No, but it can be stable with O(n) auxiliary space
#
# Description: Pick the smallest of the remaining elements, add it to the end of the sorted list.
# Requirements: Needs to be able to compare elements with <, and access them with []
#
# Usage:
#   Algorithms::Sequences::Sort.selection_sort [8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5] => [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 8]
