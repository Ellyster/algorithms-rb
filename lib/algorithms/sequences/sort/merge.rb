# Algorithm: Merge sort
# Time complexity: Ðž(n log n)
# Space complexity: O(n) auxiliary
# Stable: Yes
#
# Description: Divide in two halfs, sort the first and second half of the list separately, then merge the sorted list.
# Requirements: Needs to be able to compare elements with <, and access them with []
#
# Usage:
#   Algorithms::Sequences::Sort.insertion_sort [8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5] => [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 8]
