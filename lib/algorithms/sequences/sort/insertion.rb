# Algorithm: Insertion sort
# Time complexity: Ðž(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary
# Stable: Yes
#
# Description: Determine where the current items belongs in the list of sorted ones and insert it there.
# Requirements: Needs to be able to compare elements with <, and access them with []
#
# Usage:
#   Algorithms::Sequences::Sort.insertion_sort [8, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5] => [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 8]
